# Cholesky-Algorithm
Assignment for Numeric Calculus course

Assignment summary:
  - Implemented Cholesky algorithm for finding L matrix, given A matrix, such that A = L * L<sup>T</sup>
  - Solve A * x = b system using direct and inverse substitution methods
  - Approximate A<sup>-1</sup> using LL<sup>T</sup> decomposition</br>

Restriction:
  - Since the algorithm works with superior/inferior triangular or symetrical matrices, only one matrix of dimension n is to be allocated in memory, using superior part to store A and the inferior part for temporary storing any other matrices
  - An epsilon (epsilon < 10<sup>-5</sup>) value representing calculus precision is to be used to avoid division by 0.
